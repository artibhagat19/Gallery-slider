            <div class="des">
              An octopus is a highly intelligent marine animal known for its
              eight arms, soft body, and ability to change color for camouflage.
              It uses its flexible limbs for movement, catching prey, and
              interacting with its environment. Octopuses are renowned for their
              problem-solving skills and ability to escape enclosures. They
              defend themselves by squirting ink to confuse predators and
              quickly escape. Found in oceans worldwide, they are carnivorous,
              feeding on crabs and fish, and have a short lifespan, typically
              only living for a few years.

            <div class="des">
              A seahorse is a small, unique marine fish known for its horse-like
              head and upright swimming posture. Unlike most fish, it swims
              vertically and uses its dorsal fin to propel through the water.
              Seahorses are poor swimmers and often anchor themselves to seaweed
              or coral using their prehensile tails. One of their most
              fascinating traits is that males, not females, carry and give
              birth to the offspring. Found in shallow, warm waters around the
              world, seahorses feed on small crustaceans like plankton, using
              their tube-like snouts to suck in food.

            </div>
            <div class="des">
              A jellyfish is a soft-bodied, gelatinous marine animal
              characterized by its umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles.
              These tentacles contain specialized cells called **nematocysts**,
              which they use to sting and capture prey, such as small fish and
              plankton. Jellyfish are found in oceans worldwide and have been
              around for over 500 million years, making them one of the oldest
              living creatures. Despite their simple body structure, they can be
              highly effective swimmers, using a pulsating motion to move
              through the water. Some species have venomous stings that can be
              harmful to humans.

            </div>
            <div class="des">
              Tropical fish are vibrant, colorful fish species typically found
              in warm, freshwater or saltwater environments near the equator.
              They are popular in home aquariums due to their striking patterns
              and colors. Tropical fish thrive in stable, warm water
              temperatures and include species such as guppies, angelfish, and
              clownfish. In the wild, they inhabit coral reefs, rivers, and
              lakes, playing vital roles in their ecosystems. Their diets range
              from plant matter to small invertebrates, depending on the
              species. Proper care of tropical fish in aquariums requires
              maintaining consistent water conditions and providing a balanced
              diet.

              A cuttlefish is a marine animal known for its intelligence,
              camouflage abilities, and distinctive internal shell called a
              **cuttlebone**. Belonging to the cephalopod family, which includes
              octopuses and squids, cuttlefish can rapidly change their color
              and texture to blend into their surroundings, thanks to
              specialized skin cells called **chromatophores**. They have eight
              arms and two tentacles, which they use to catch prey like small
              fish and crustaceans. Cuttlefish are also known for their large,
              W-shaped eyes, which provide excellent vision. Found in oceans
              worldwide, they are highly adaptable hunters and have a short
              lifespan of about 1-2 years.

            <div class="des">
              Biofluorescence is the phenomenon where living organisms absorb
              light, typically ultraviolet (UV), and re-emit it as visible
              light. This process is seen in various species, including certain
              types of fish, corals, and jellyfish. Unlike bioluminescence,
              which involves chemical reactions to produce light,
              biofluorescence relies on the absorption and re-emission of light.
              This vibrant display often serves multiple purposes, such as
              communication, camouflage, or attracting prey. For example, some
              corals and fish can exhibit brilliant colors under UV light, which
              may help them blend in with their environment or signal to
              potential mates.
